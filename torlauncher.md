It seems that the Tor Project repository URL might have changed or is temporarily unavailable. Let's try an alternative method to install Tor on Fedora using the official package from the Fedora repositories.

### Step 1: Install Tor from the Fedora Repositories

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - You can find the Terminal in your applications menu or press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

2. **Install Tor**:
   - Fedora includes Tor in its default repositories, so you can install it directly with:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install tor -y
     ```

### Step 2: Install Tor Browser

You can still install the Tor Browser using the `torbrowser-launcher` available in the Fedora repositories.

1. **Install Tor Browser Launcher**:
   - Run the following command to install the Tor Browser Launcher:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install torbrowser-launcher -y
     ```

2. **Launch Tor Browser**:
   - You can launch Tor Browser by typing:
     ```bash
     torbrowser-launcher
     ```
   - The launcher will download the latest version of Tor Browser and set it up for you.

### Step 3: Start and Enable the Tor Service

1. **Start the Tor Service**:
   - After installing Tor, start the service using:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start tor
     ```

2. **Enable Tor to Start on Boot**:
   - Ensure that Tor starts automatically when your system boots:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable tor
     ```

3. **Check Tor Status**:
   - Verify that Tor is running:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status tor
     ```
   - If Tor is running correctly, you should see an active status.

### Step 4: Use Tor Browser

1. **Connect to the Tor Network**:
   - After the setup, launch Tor Browser, and click `Connect` to establish a secure connection.

2. **Browse the Web**:
   - Once connected, you can browse the web anonymously using the Tor network.

### Step 5: Optional - Configure Tor (if needed)

If you need to customize your Tor setup (e.g., use bridges, proxies), you can do so by editing the `torrc` file:

1. **Edit the torrc File**:
   - Open the configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
     ```
   - Make any necessary changes, then save and exit.

2. **Restart Tor**:
   - After making changes, restart Tor with:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart tor
     ```

This alternative method should allow you to install and use Tor on Fedora without relying on the previously mentioned repository. Let me know if you run into any further issues!
